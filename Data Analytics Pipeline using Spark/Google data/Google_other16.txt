While the Justice Department has said that times, and definitions of competition, have changed, AT&amp;T has stuck by traditional metrics that would permit such a combination. "story-body-text story-content" ="268" ="1915"To prove that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&amp;T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger: Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal.

"story-body-text story-content" ="260" ="11040"And Rockwell had some defenses that Emerson couldn’t breach, including a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. That meant Emerson couldn’t wage a proper proxy fight to replace directors at the target company’s board.
