Sending innocent children to kill themselves and others. And the visuals in the article help you picture what is going on. It makes you feel more attached to the characters. The determination of some of the girls is very good. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Gabby Wilga /appreciated how the article “makes the reader think”: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The breathtaking visuals and quotes enhanced the realness of the unthinkable tale. On top of that, the article had my attention the whole time as it was hard hitting and thorough. The text makes the reader think without realizing they’re thinking with its high quality "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Abby Lynch /was horrified by what she read: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"After reading this article it gave me a new outlook on society today. The fact that teenage girls our age, kidnapped and forced to strap bombs to their backs and told to walk right to suicide is disgusting. Nobody should have to live a life of such horror... The fact that these two girls had the strength to just sit down and talk about this is humbling. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Erin P. / was awed by the strength in the girls: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"This article really made me think and use every ounce of empathy and compassion in my body. I can’t even fathom how absolutely mortifying and horrific their experience must’ve been. It’s awful that such a thing had to happen to such intelligent young girls. At the same time, I really admire their sense of drive and determination to escape the situation. Being brainwashed and under that pressure would seem like there was no way out. If I was put in their shoes, I surely wouldn’t have reacted as collectively and responsibly as these girls did in such a dire situation. Its awful that people there are unsafe around women because of what these awful people have done to them. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Nicholas Butkovich from Pennsylvania /wrote poetically about "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0" “/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-coping.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"‘Like Going Back in Time’: Puerto Ricans Put Survival Skills to Use/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”/: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"When life goes down the wrong path and everything seems to be against you, where do you turn? When you do not know where to look for help and those who should be helping you are nowhere to be seen, to whom do you go? The Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria are living this exact same experience. But instead of your one bad day, this is there life now. Until someone comes to help or life or neighbors unexpectedly gets better, they are not going anywhere. They must turn to themselves and their neighbors, for the government is nowhere to be seen. They must start to rely on primitive survival skills and do whatever they can to keep living in some resemblance of normalcy. People who usually get by well are now stuck into the prison known as poverty and the ones who were already in that prison, find no escape. The hurricane brought no hope or goodwill in its constant wind and rain luggage. The people must provide this for themselves. The people must create their own hope of survival and their own goodwill towards their neighbors as together they survive through the night. And the next one, and the next one, until life returns to its state of normalcy and the faint memories of these terrible nights fade away. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Three students/ commented on  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"“/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/chimpanzees-goodall.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”/: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Katie Doherty /was amazed to realize animals may have human emotions: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans,” was an enthralling read. It is fascinating that Chimpanzees share many personality traits with humans. Some of these include anxiety, depression, and self-control... This experiment should be preformed on other animals, such as dogs. If it proves that dogs experience similar emotions, it is amazing to think your dog could be feeling the same anxiety or depression as you. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Sami K /added questions: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I think it is cool how scientists can study these chimpanzees and see how their personality and attitude can connect to our lives. They said that wild and captive chimpanzees had similar personality traits. I also thought it was heartwarming seeing Jane Goodall observe and care for the chimpanzees in Gombe National Park in what today is modern Tanzania. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Some questions I had while reading, "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"How do scientists accurately understand animals personalities and attitudes? "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Why do wild and captive chimpanzees have the same traits? "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Do chimpanzees attitudes change as they get older like humans? "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"How many traits do humans and chimps commonly share? "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Kylie E /was awed by Jane Goodall and her life, posing a number of good questions, and writing: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Jane is an amazing role model, for example, she doesn’t care what other’s think but rather strives to be different and unique. This is the kind of motivation girl’s need today to show them that they can break the sexist boundaries that the society has put up. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Dillon Putz /was inspired by “ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/style/the-end-of-freeways.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Once So Chic and Swooshy, Freeways Are Falling Out of Favor/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”:/ "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I felt that this situation is good, not only for the place it was about, but for cities too. Removing large highways and freeways can totally open a city back up and make it a more beautiful place. I think it would be cool if a freeway was decommissioned and turned into a long park. Like the concrete would be covered with grass and trees. It would be good for running and biking. Especially if a raised freeway became this, it would be like a park on legs! I think cities should look into this, I think it would be cool to rebuild a city by destroying a crucial part to it. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Rebecca Grube/ was intrigued by the vision offered in  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"“/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/upshot/taxibots-sensors-and-self-driving-shuttles-a-glimpse-at-an-internet-city-in-toronto.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Google’s Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0".”:/ "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The idea that Google’s technologists are considering designing a major city from the internet is unbelievable. In my opinion, I can’t even comprehend what Toronto, the chosen city, would look like if this was done. When the article explained a few of the features the city could offer, such as a thermal energy grid, I couldn’t help but wonder if every city in the future would accommodate such technology. But then again, how successful could such a large, complicated project be? To me, the concept seems like the beginning of a dystopian story where technology controls a world displayed as a utopia. Yes, the illustration within the article looks like a place where I would want to live, but is it too good to be true? Can a city run by technology solve all of our problems and live up to its expectations? "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Sofia Pollack /wrote charmingly about what she learned from  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"“/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/beets-red-enzymes.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"How Beets Become Beet Red/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”:/ "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Reading this article, the thought occurred to me that there are myriad career paths one may choose to follow in life. As shown in this excerpt, there are actually biologists that study the molecular levels and evolution of beets. This made me wonder how these people came to ask “hmm... why exactly is a beet red?” or “Is this beet’s redness due to the same reason why a cranberry is red?”. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"It all seems so completely incredible how an adult can still ask the questions of a child. And society still says that adults have no imagination... just look at this article! I learned that beets are their trademark scarlet red due to amino acids like tyrosine, developed further by enzymes to accentuate the hue. The writer that one of the reasons why beets are red is to attract pollinators with their dazzling appearance. If this piece of news wasn’t mindboggling enough, I also learned that beets have enzymes “...that increase the tyrosine used to make the painkilling molecule, [and] could have effects on how that drug and others are made...” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In all, this article by Veronique Greenwood responded to the question that I didn’t even know I wanted an answer to. And that’s pretty awesome. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Jessica Huckel /was sympathetic after reading “ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/hikers-murder-suicide-joshua-tree.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Missing Hikers Found Dead of Gunshot Wounds, and Locked in an Embrace/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”:/ "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"As I read this article, I felt sympathetic towards both the families of Rachel Nguyen and Joseph Orbeso. Rachel and Joseph were only in their early twenties when they died. Things like this always make me think that if they did something different, like chose a different trail to hike on, they wouldn’t have died. This article really does prove that one small decision can make a huge impact. I also couldn’t help but think just how terrified Rachel and Joseph were, they probably were wondering how long until they would be rescued, that is if anyone would ever find them. It’s a scary thought, but stories like these make me value life a little more. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Riley Fleisch /was angry in response to  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"“/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/politics/soldiers-widow-says-trump-struggled-to-remember-sgt-la-david-johnsons-name.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Soldier’s Widow Says Trump Struggled to Remember Sgt. La David Johnson’s Name/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"”:/ "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In reading the article, “ Soldier’s Widow Says Trump Struggled to Remember Sgt. La David Johnson’s Name”, my disgust and utter embarrassment only grew for the president. Not only did he have the audacity to say “He knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,” to a woman who lost her husband in combat, he couldn’t even remember the brave man’s name. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Many will try to defend this man by saying he was nice enough to even call, but this response in sad and lacks evidence of care. It is customary for widows/families of fallen soldiers to be contacted by the president since the draft was put in place. Even then, Trump was many weeks late to his call and left the family with many unanswered questions. Along with the refusal to let Sgt. Johnson’s wife, see the body. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"This one situation is just another example of why Donald Trump is unfitting for the role of president. From his disrespect for justice, women, and fallen soldiers, he is just far too immature. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"_________ "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Our most popular writing prompt this week was our existential Student Opinion question “ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0" "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/learning/is-struggle-essential-to-happiness.html" target="_blank" title=""Is Struggle Essential to Happiness?/” "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The majority of readers agreed that to achieve bliss, one must first encounter hardship. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Juanita from Maryland/ illustrated this idea with a detailed example: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Let’s say you have to learn a dance for a show you’re doing. You can’t seem to get this one step and you just keep struggling and doing it over and over. Until one day you finally get that step, you successfully hit that step right on beat. You feel that euphoria of finally hitting that step correctly, you get that sense of accomplishment and happiness. Now if you were to just easily hit that step and get the dance overall, you’re just doing it over and over again and it becomes boring because you know you can do it, it’s easy. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Rose M. from the United States/ shared her personal experiences: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In one period of my life, I struggled with depression. But, until I hit that cold, rock bottom, was when I truly started coming up and feeling better as a person. After overcoming something so unhealthy, I felt happier than ever. I became a lot more grateful and compassionate. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Anandeep from Pennsylvania/ explained the big picture: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"By going through the hardships and struggles life throws your way, you realize that each time that you were knocked down you stood up taller...What you do not realize is that the struggle you faced taught you lessons, and without those lessons, you are bound to make the same mistakes eventually. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Rhyon House from Georgia/ gave this example: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I guarantee you that in any sport if you don’t practice and show up and expect the best results they will not come simply because you haven’t put in the work in order to achieve greatness. If you ever look at any successful scholar, artist, entrepreneur, or athlete; they’ve all been through some sort of struggle to be considered successful, and success is how many measure happiness. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Marissa Sheirling from LGHS/ finds joy in the simple things: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I draw happiness mostly from my family and friends. But i also draw happiness from everyday things like laughing and talking to friends. Yes i do think every human being can find happiness in something, even if it is just being happy with being alive. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Lizeth V 3D from YC CLIP/ rejected the idea that things can make us happy: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Most of us think that happiness is in materialism, buying clothes, shoes, accessories, etc. But, this is called consumerism and a lot of people believe that they are happy because they possess those kind of things. However, I agree with the author, I believe that the happiness is in the simple things of life such as have health, tranquility, have access to education and know that my family is good. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"A few commenters, though, disagreed, and felt struggle can reduce happiness. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Sophia from Maryland/ wants to be free of struggle: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In my opinion, happiness can also be defined of the lack of struggle in life. I know that the times where I feel most happy are times when there is nothing bugging at the back of my mind or making me worry about the future. Anticipation for events and goals to come, whether they be positive or negative, causes me great stress, which dilutes any happiness that I may have experienced before the event had the potential to happen. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Adriana 3D from YC-CLIP/ empathized with those who feel so depressed they can’t find happiness: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If you have many problems in your environment where you grow, of course you may be feeling empty, and nothing is enough for you. It is so difficult to find the Happiness and it is possible you see everything black, and not see any light, not see any future...If you feeling depress you can’t dream, you can’t love what do you... You need looking the solution in your life first.

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Many, like  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Alyssa S. from NWHS/, thought he was a great choice: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In my opinion, Justin Timberlake is the perfect person to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show. He is known by a wide variety of age ranges. My parents listen to Justin Timberlake, my friends and I listen to him, my older brother and his friends, as well as my younger brother and his friends, even my very young cousins, enjoy listening to Justin Timberlake’s music. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Jenny from USA/ was equally excited: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I think he would be a great and memorable halftime performer. In recent years, he has released more upbeat songs that would get the crowd excited for the last half of the Super bowl game. Because he has been capturing the hearts of many generations, it would be a great experience for everyone in the family. However, I would enjoy seeing a new face show off their talent. I’ve been loving Sam Smith lately, but his songs would be too down for the occasion. Perhaps I’d enjoy if Kendrick Lamar killed the stage with his catchy and relatable tunes. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Others...not so much.  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Javier HHHS from Michigan /was irked by the N.F.L.’s decision: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Justin Timberlake is a terrible choice. To start with he has already performed at the halftime show. I swear the NFL just pulled out a phone book started calling some numbers and chose the first person that picked up. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"This is lazy, find someone new. Speaking of new, that is exactly what Timberlake isn’t he is a blast from the past. I don’t even know one of his songs. Who the heck was he did he perform solo, was he in a band? I don’t know. The performer for the half-time show has to be someone new, who appeals to all audiences. Someone like Kanye West, the Weekend, or Taylor Swift just to name a few better candidates. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Logan HHHS from Hanover/ didn’t think Justin Timberlake’s music would suit the occasion: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"To be honest i think he is a very talented artist however his music is not my cup of tea...Who I would want to preform at the super bowl half time show would be, Lil Dickey, Lil Yatchy, Hopsin. Notice these are all rappers and for me Justin Timberlake just doesn’t have any upbeat to get the football teams fired up. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And many students gave their own recommendations for who should perform instead. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Christian HHHS from Hanover Horton/ said: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I would like to see Lil Yachty, Kodak Black and Ugly God. I think that they would put on a show at halftime because I personally think that they are currently some of America’s greatest rappers. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"AryannaHHHS from Hanover, Mich./ proposed: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"It would be nice to see someone new do the performance, rather than Katy Perry or Beyonce, but that’s just me. If I was able to pick someone, I would want to see someone like DJ Snake or something. I love their music and how they set up their music and performances, but at the same time they could also have guest singers too like MO or Justin Bieber. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Judy HHHS from Michigan/ wrote: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If I could see anyone perform at the Super Bowl it would be Bruno Mars. He is a pop sensation that everyone knows and many of his songs are played on the radio. His music is fun, and I think he could get the crowd really involved with his performance. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"ZachL.HHHS from Hanover/ recommended a unique genre of musician: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If I could see anyone perform at the Super Bowl it would be a band like Pantera. They would have to replace their guitar player for the show because he has passed, but I think Pantera has changed music. Just seeing some rock and metal music at a big show like this would shock the world and be absolutely awesome for people that love metal or rock music. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Noah HHHS from Michigan/ did, as well: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If I could see anyone perform the Halftime show I would have to pick the British rock band Queen. I know that this is unlikely as Freddie Mercury, the band’s’ lead singer, died in 1991; I would love to see the band perform the Halftime show nonetheless. Their music was exoctic for the time and whenever I listen to their music it’s always a breath of fresh air. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Hayden HHHS from Mrs Jobs Classroom/ suggested three artists: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If I could see anyone perform at the halftime show it would be a mixture of three people. The three people would be Lil Yachty, ugly god, and Ice JJ Fish. These are three of my favorite rappers and they would put an an amazing halftime show.

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Our Picture Prompt, “ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0" "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/learning/a-new-friend.html" target="_blank" title=""A New Friend/,” yielded several imaginative beginnings to short stories. Here are two of our favorites. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Grace S. from Germantown, Md., /intrigued us with this opening: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Being the shy girl she is, she never got too close to others. Some actually blamed it on her “problem,” but the doctors never called it that. And the doctor’s were her closest friends. They told her what was going on, asked her how she was doing, answered her questions, treated her somewhat like the person she was. Now, she’s stuck with another girl, in a closed ward. The other girl almost didn’t realize she was there, but she couldn’t stop watching the other girl. She was fascinated. Everything the other girl did was so natural to her, yet it was so unusual. Most other girls never got too close to her, but now she has the chance to get close to another girl. The chance for a new friend. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Lillian B. from Asheville /went in a supernatural direction, and we loved the mystery she set up: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I look at my new foster sister and I wonder “how is she doing so well?” There she laid spread over the bed. Looking at the ceiling. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Hey Annabel, do you unpack everything?” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Look and see.” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Look and see. She said to every question I asked. She always would smile after saying it too. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Annabel, do you feel well?” I waited for her response. Annabel looked at the ceiling some more. Then she stood upright. She looked at me and gave me a big toothy smile. I got up from my bed and stride towards her bed. I loom over her. I tried to smile. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“You can tell me anything you are worried about, you know that right?” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“You are scared. Look it is all over your face. See?” Annabel pointed to the floor with a grin on her face. I followed her finger and saw something unbelievable. A monster slowly forming. I took a step back. I dash over to my bed, and with every step, the floor seemed to become water. When I got there, I yelled at Annabel, “What is happening!?” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Look and see.” "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The monster started to form. The shape of it looks like me. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"A cold sweat covered me to head and toe when I looked at it. Annabel’s grin left her face. She turns away from me and the copy. Glancing back to me then flopping on the bed, belly side down. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Do you not want to see?” She asked sounding upset. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"“Make it disappear!” Annabel reaches to the floor and touched it. The floor moved like water and the copy of me disappeared. I put my hand to my mouth in shock. Who is Annabel?

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Drew Scott from Asheville, N.C., /referenced famous artists who started out with graffiti: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"When I see people denying that graffiti is art, I think of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Basquiat first achieved fame as a graffiti artist in Lower Manhattan in the 1970’s. Nowadays, though he has been dead for 29 years, his art sells for millions upon millions of dollars. He could have gone nowhere, and we wouldn’t be able to enjoy his art today if not for the spray paint pieces he made when he was a teenager. It is a similar situation for Keith Haring, who painted on buildings both legally and illegally. I’m not condoning law breaking, but would we would be better off without the works of Keith Haring and Jean-Michael Basquiat? "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Do buildings that can have the paint washed off of them matter more than the budding creativity that could belong to a new Basquiat or Haring? "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Nathanie Doralus from Florida/ wished for a legal way to protect graffiti: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I believe that graffiti is an expression of skill and creativity that conveys important messages and evokes powerful thoughts and emotions. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Though I believe that graffiti is owned by the artists themselves, I wish that there was some sort of formal, legal way of granting the permission to paint the owner’s property without the risk of arrest nor the risk of having it covered or removed without the artist’s permission. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Graffiti is a significant part of urban American culture that has the right to be viewed in person and not just in pictures. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., /feels graffiti is a unique art form and should be protected: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Imagine that something that you worked so hard on, that held meaning for you, was destroyed. How would you feel? In my opinion, aerosol art most definitely classifies as a work of art. These works of art hold meaning and give a unique and vibrant decoration to our society. The artist who makes the aerosol art should be the owner of that art because they are the ones who put in the hard work in making these masterpieces. But I also understand the fact that whoever owns the property might not want their building covered in graffiti. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Xander Kruvczuk from United States of America /pointed out that graffiti is often “illegal artwork”: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If an artist is hired or asked to paint a mural or create any other piece of art, I do not consider this graffiti. I consider this to be commissioned art that is allowed to be there. Graffiti is illegal artwork that an artist put in a place regardless of what the rules are. I don’t think graffiti should be protected. If people want art on walls or the side of bridges, they can just hire an artist to do it for them. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Riley Thomas from Asheville, N.C., /agreed that it is not protected unless on your own property: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I don’t think the artist owns the graffiti if they have painted it on someone else’s private property...If you want to make graffiti or “aerosol art” you can create it on your own property. But I do not believe it should be protected unless you were asked to make it.

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Anandeep from Pennsylvania /used statistics to respond: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I believe that men do have it easier than women doing things in their everyday lives. For one, if you look at certain careers in most situation you will find that men are a lot more favored than women. For instance, when you think of the medical field, you automatically assume that men are doctors and women are nurses. This is because 74% of doctors are male (26% female), while 91% of nurses tend to be female (9% male). If you wonder why these statistics are true, it’s because society predetermines these roles for men and women. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Addison Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., /felt that it would take years for women to be treated equally: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In my opinion, men do have it easier than women. Women are burdened with a great deal of responsibilities in her life. No matter what, every girl is going to be judged in their life. Whether it is the way she feels, acts, works or takes care of things, the fear of acceptance is a major problem in a girl’s life. Her acceptance or approval is decided by the critical world. Men are not judged the way a women is. They have always been able to vote, run for office, and own property. Although gender equality is becoming more equal in the past, men have had all the rights. Women have traditionally been treated like second class citizens and it will take years for the effects to go away. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Todd George from Northeast intermediate/ disagreed, and said: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I think girls/women have it easier because boys/men are always buying them things and taking them out to eat. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"But  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Carolyn from Ohio /argued with him: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"A free meal does not even come close to covering the earning difference between men and women. I’d rather the opportunity to make an equal wage. You can keep your meal and your expectation for sex afterwards.

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Hannah Hope from Pennsylvania/ isn’t alone anymore after reading a poem: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"A work of art that changed my life was Shane Koyczan’s poem, ‘To This Day’. It is a monologue about bullying and how it impacted his life and the lives of two people he knows...This came into my life at a great time because I had started getting into stupid kid drama. I was always sad and I felt like no one would really understand, until I heard this one day in dance class and I was overwhelmed by emotion and I can safely say I haven’t felt the same since. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Now, every time I start to feel upset about bullying and drama, I listen to this again and I feel like I’m not alone anymore. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"katie thompson from Georgia/ found meaning in an animated movie: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"the work of art that inspires me the most is the movie how to train your dragon from a animation studio called dream works...The message is that you can find friends in unlikely places and that you shouldnt judge everyone by the bad done by the few of their kind. therefore this movie inspires me to try and be friends with anyone and everyone no matter what they look like, and that i need to work hard to be able to produce my own animations. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"dark brown ink from California/ referenced a book: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Dorothy Bryant’s book “The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You” begins badly and soon becomes magnificent. Probably read it 20 times over the years since it first came out. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Midori P.O from Georgia /says her choice may be “cliche,” but it still inspires: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The work of art that inspires me is cliche as of now, but I still hold it in high regards. Lin Manuel-Miranda’s “Hamilton” inspires me to remember the people who paved the way for America Today. It also inspires me through it’s song and rap lyrics to live life and make my part in someone else’s story so they can tell mine. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Danielle Filandino from Pennsylvania/ accepted herself and others after hearing a song: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"My own “M.Butterfly” is a song. This song is Girls/Girls/Boys by Panic! At the Disco. Girls/Girls/Boys inspires to to work for a world without hate. It inspires me to work for a world with equality. The song is about being yourself, and not really caring what others think. Knowing this song exists helps me understand and accept myself. The music piece helps me let go of all of my worries and stress. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And finally,  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Xander Kruvczuk United States of America/ said a movie changed his life for the better: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The work of art that has changed my life is Makoto Shinkai’s, Kimi no Na wa. In the movie, both characters experience a huge change in their lives and they have to learn to cope with it. In this case, their appearances change entirely. This movie has showed me that I can be confident in whoever I am and in whatever I look like. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"_________/ "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"This week, commenters were intrigued by our Picture Prompt “ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/learning/freedom.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Freedom/” and offered an array of interesting interpretations. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Many thought the image had to do with freedom of speech. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Seth D.W. from Locust Grove/ proposed this interpretation: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"This picture represents people as a whole not having the power of freedom of speech. I say this because not everyone everywhere has the power to speak out about there thoughts and beliefs. In America, citizens have freedom of speech and the right to protest peacefully. However, citizens in many other countries don’t have that power to speak out about there believes, and this picture is exactly explaining just that. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Ru’Kiyia Jackson from Locust Grove High School/ brought in another source to support her response: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"To me I think this picture represents somebody who has some things they would like to say but there being stopped. Luckily, we have the First Amendment which states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” But according to some people they still don’t believe people have the right to state some things. This is related to how people have the right to speech on and off of their job. In my opinion I think that people have the right to do anything that the 27 amendments say. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Others believed the illustration was related to the idea of political correctness. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Emily from Georgia/ succinctly put it this way: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"People are not allowed to say what they want to because too many people get hurt and offended. Americans these days take every word you say and turn it around into something racial or political. The person who created this picture probably feels like they do not have a right to say what they want and to say what they feel. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Irena Naida from KOP in Pennsylvania/ asked: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Everyone is crazy about our country having freedom of speech, but when someone says a comment they believe in they are automatically judge. Is that really what freedom is supposed to be? "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Drew Scott from Asheville, N.C.,/ answered: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I think this is about how many people believe that freedom of speech has somehow been taken away from us in the recent years, just because people will tell you when something offends them, or they will ask you to stop saying it. The people who say this don’t really understand freedom of speech. True freedom of speech is being able to say whatever you want, and being able to tell other people whatever you want about what they said. If you say that you hate a certain race, you can expect people of this race (or even not of that race) telling you that they don’t like your opinion. If you don’t want people to be mad at you or be offended by your comment, don’t make the comment. Being prepared for backlash to your opinions is a good human skill people should learn. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Angel Cerna from California/ saw it in darker political terms: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I think this picture relate to when people are being ruled by someone that doesn’t want them to tell the truth. And I think this is a big problem in any country, an example is when a big secret is discover and the government say that they don’t know about this, but they know everything about it. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Giselle from California/ gave this unique perspective: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"i think that the guy is depressed and he want to ask for help or needs to talk to some one but something doesn’t let him. some people tend to feel this way because they might feel lonely or maybe something happen to them and just cant tell no one because someone is telling them not too. they might even be bullied by someone and they want to speak up but they cant "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"_________/ "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"We asked students, "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0" “/ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/learning/what-kind-of-education-system-do-you-think-is-best.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"What Kind of Education System Do You Think Is Best?/ "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"” /They had opinions: "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., /wanted a system that creates more than “drones”: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Having an educational system that encourages experiential learning and personality development has many benefits. It allows you to be less stressed about getting a good grade and becoming more focused on learning and keeping the knowledge you have obtained...Instead of having people who are drones of society, we need problem solvers that think outside the box to develop new ideas. People like Steve Jobs who shaped the way we lived to day thought outside of the box on everything that they did. If everyone was just worried about some meaningless letter grade and their test scores, then our society would never advance. Nobody would come up with new ideas that shape the future. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Anon from Germantown, Md., /wrote about the pressure on students, the cheating that can result: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The idea behind education is you can’t be successful without a bachelor’s degree or higher. This makes succeeding more important than learning, so kids are more focused on passing than actually understanding the material. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"My school has great resources and staff, and the curriculum is usually challenging but not too difficult; however, most kids I know are experienced cheaters because of the workload and how much is graded. We are told if we get bad test scores we aren’t smart and the teachers’ careers are dependent on how the students perform. AP classes are pushed if not forced on students to boost the rating of the school in terms of students in high level classes. I think if it was more relaxed and encouraged more learning from free will, students would perform better. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Andrew G. from Germantown, Md., /feels his own school emphasizes memorization over learning: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"The school that I currently attend is a very competitive school. We frequently compete with other schools in sports or clubs like the robotics club. At the same time, our school is somewhat focused on academic success but it mainly seems to care about memorization. The students’ job is to memorize the content, get tested on it, and receive a grade for it. It’s rare that the students are tested on the topic again. They just move on to the next topic and forget the old one. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"In my opinion, this is no way to educate students. If they are just going to forget about it, why even teach the content? The worst part is that many students don’t even know what they don’t know, so they don’t realize how much teaching they have forgotten or what to relearn. It seems like our school is so oriented on competitiveness that we’re trying to make up for the faulty education system, but it is not working. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"_________/ "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"We loved reading everyone’s thoughts on  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/learning/what-do-you-think-of-the-obamas-portrait-choices.html" target="_blank" title="" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"the Obamas’ portrait choices/, as well as your own ideas for which artists you would like to create a portrait of you. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Olivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., /enthusiastically approved of the Obamas’ portrait artists: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"It is important that the Obamas chose contemporary African-American artists because it is a defiance of the traditional ways that have been established and allows for the exposure of artists and art styles that have been less than abundant in a white-dominated field. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And  "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Nathanie Doralus from Florida/ was inspired by them: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Compared to past presidential portraits, I think that the Obamas’ portraits will be much more vibrant in color and will emphasize their distinct black features. The work of the two artists is full of bright colors and are all portraits of black men and women, young and old, in different places and clothing, very much unlike the past presidential portraits. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I am only familiar with a few black artists like Elizabeth Catlett and Jean-Michel Basquiat. But after viewing his work now, I’d would choose Kehinde Wiley to create a portrait of me. I love the boldness of his art and how he seems to pay close attention to details using light and shadows. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Soco from FSI in Asheville, N.C.,/ would want a photograph as a portrait: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I feel when people think of portraits, they think of paintings. what is hard for people to remember there are other mediums that can be used to portraiture. I have an interest in photography, especially film photograph. "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"I would choose photographer Annie Libovitz to take my portrait. Her portraits are enigmatic, captivating and classy. Leibovitz knows how to use lighting, filters symmetry, scenery and other assets to her advantage to to form an enthralling portrait. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"Hollie Sulliva from Newport, R.I.,/ suggested another unconventional “portrait” choice: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"If I had to choose one artist to represent my legacy via art I’d choose artist Benjamin Clementine who is a musician. I would have him write a biographical album chronicling my life I feel his style is very conducive to storytelling and what better than the story to tell than my life. I would have him do lots of strange instrumentation and weird time signatures. I would also have artist howard garner cushing do a very traditional portrait of me for the album art. I’ve always admired his portraits and I’d love to see one of me because I am just so vain.
