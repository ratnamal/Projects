"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The anger and fear provoked by the advent of President Trump have led to explosive growth for progressive advocacy groups determined to oppose the president’s agenda and, crucially, to elect Democrats to local office — groups like  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/" target="_blank" title=""Indivisible,  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.runforsomething.net/" target="_blank" title=""Run for Something,  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.emergeamerica.org/" target="_blank" title=""Emerge America and  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.colorofchange.org/" target="_blank" title=""Color of Change (through its PAC). "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/07/24/does-the-opening-predict-a-wave/" target="_blank" title=""number of Democratic candidates filing for office at all levels of government has surged; the trickle of money into liberal grass-roots programs has become a  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-political-groups-see-surge-in-donations-1479247461" target="_blank" title=""flood; and turnout in post-2016 Democratic primaries has reached  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nbc29.com/story/35674072/record-voter-turnout-in-2017-va-primary-election" target="_blank" title=""record levels. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Until this year, liberals and Democrats have been  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/opinion/the-state-by-state-revival-of-the-right.html" target="_blank" title=""notoriously neglectful about building local organizations to back candidates for school boards, City Councils and state legislatures. And in fact the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/us/elections/state-legislature-change-in-control.html" target="_blank" title=""differing levels of  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voters-who-stayed-home-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/" target="_blank" title=""participation by the right and the left remain striking. The electoral effects have been stark. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In 2009, according to the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/partisan-composition.aspx" target="_blank" title=""National Council of State Legislatures, there were 4,082 Democrats serving in state legislatures and 3,223 Republicans. By 2016, the numbers had reversed: 3,135 Democrats and 4,177 Republicans. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In 2009, Democrats controlled both the state senate and house in 27 states, the Republicans 14. After the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled both branches of the legislatures in 32 states to 14 for the Democrats. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The importance of these trends cannot be overstated. State legislatures not only control redistricting in most states — a key to determining which party will control the House after the 2020 census — but also serve as a training ground where politicians learn the ropes of winning elections and governing. In this respect, state legislatures are a key source of new talent. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.emergeamerica.org/" target="_blank" title=""Emerge America, an organization that recruits Democratic women to run for office, is stressing the need for candidates to file for state legislative seats. In the first six months of 2016, the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/search?execution=e2s6&amp;pacid=42611" target="_blank" title=""group raised $500,219; during the first half of this year, it raised $2.03 million. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Andrea Dew Steele, the organization’s president and founder, describes Emerge as “the beginning of the food chain,” performing basic training for women, many of them seeking office for the first time. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In 2017, Emerge expanded operations from 17 to 22 states, including such deep red states as Alabama, South Carolina and Louisiana. Unlike  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.emilyslist.org/" target="_blank" title=""Emily’s List, a more established group that supports Democratic women, Emerge pointedly does not have a litmus test requiring its candidates to back abortion rights. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"One of the biggest successes so far this year is the organization called Indivisible, founded in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election by  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.jta.org/2017/02/23/news-opinion/politics/meet-the-jewish-couple-leading-the-trump-resistance" target="_blank" title=""Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, a married couple who both worked as aides to Democratic congressmen. Indivisible now claims 5,983 local chapters, with at least two in every congressional district. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Indivisible has played a leading role in turning out voters at congressional town halls to voice their opposition to Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare — a tactic explicitly copied from the Tea Party’s organizing drive in 2009-2010. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"While support for these relatively new groups on the left is growing, the track record of some of the more established organizations is mixed. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.dlcc.org/" target="_blank" title=""Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has traditionally been the single most important group devoted to winning state senate and state house seats. In terms of financial support, it has  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/search?execution=e2s4&amp;pacid=4103" target="_blank" title=""seen a modest increase. In the first six months of 2016, the D.L.C.C. raised $4.03 million compared to $4.36 million during the first six months of 2017. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ofa.us/about-ofa/" target="_blank" title=""Organizing for Action, an offshoot of Obama’s presidential campaigns, has experienced a steady drop in revenues: from $26 million in 2013 to $14.4 million in 2014 to $9 million in 2015 to $6 million in 2016. O.F.A. raised $3.4 million during the first half of 2017, according to Jesse Lehrich, the organization’s communications director. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Money is not the only factor in politics — if it were, the efforts of these progressive groups would be doomed. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Republicans and conservative organizations have had the financial advantage in the fight for state legislatures, and they will continue to have it during the 2018 election cycle. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Take the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://rslc.gop/" target="_blank" title=""Republican State Leadership Committee. It has  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/search?execution=e1s3&amp;pacid=6483" target="_blank" title=""raised $6.53 million so far this year, $2.17 million more than the amount raised by its Democratic counterpart. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"On a larger scale, the immense network of organizations  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/01/06/mapping-the-koch-brothers-massive-political-network/?utm_term=.dab54f08a356" target="_blank" title=""created by the Koch brothers and other conservative donors far outstrips the structures that Democrats and liberals are piecing together. USA Today  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/25/koch-brothers-political-network-promises-raise-and-spend-more-money-2018-races/427015001/" target="_blank" title=""reported in June that in 2017-18 the Koch machine plans to spend $300- $400 million on elections and lobbying at every level. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"If we look at enthusiasm, however, Democrats have the clear advantage this year. Take special legislative elections. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-are-overperforming-in-special-elections-almost-everywhere/" target="_blank" title=""an analysis published by FiveThirtyEight, Nathaniel Rakich found that in the first 15 special elections to fill vacant state legislative seats in 2017, Democratic candidates outperformed past Democratic presidential candidates by an average of 14.4 percentage points. On Aug. 8, Phil Miller, a Democrat,  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://iowastartingline.com/2017/08/08/iowa-democrats-win-special-election-in-trump-22-district/" target="_blank" title=""won a special election to fill a vacant seat in the Iowa House by 10 points in a district that Trump carried by 22. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Another gauge of enthusiasm is the willingness of prospective candidates to enter contests in the first place. Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute and a professor of political science at the University at Albany,  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/07/24/does-the-opening-predict-a-wave/" target="_blank" title=""tracked the number of Democratic and Republican challengers (in other words, non-incumbents) who filed their candidacies with the Federal Election Commission and had raised $5,000 as of June 30. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Malbin compared the data to prior years and his findings are noteworthy: So far this year, there are already 209 Democratic challengers, more than in any of the previous seven election cycles — and more than double the 78 Republican challengers in 2009, the year that led up to the Republican wave election of 2010. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"While motivation is high on the left, there is no guarantee that it will be well directed. Many of the newly involved enthusiasts are political neophytes. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/thedaskocpol/home" target="_blank" title=""Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, has been studying the rise of Indivisible in eight mid-western counties. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In a phone interview, Skocpol said the quality and effectiveness of Indivisible chapters “ran the gamut” in terms of efficacy, with only some developing structured organizations. There are groups, she said, that are equipped to mobilize members to act on specific issues and to get voters to the polls, while others are far less prepared to engage on either front. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Along similar lines, a Democratic operative with extensive experience in grass-roots organizing — who asked not to be identified — told me that "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"We are working with many of these new organizations in a variety of ways. As we have non-disclosure agreements with all of the organizations we work with, details have to come from them. The growth in activism that these groups have both spurred and harnessed outstrips anything I have seen in decades previously. That said, this activism is pushing against  structural headwinds and entrenched power. Further, still unknown is whether the geographic distribution of this activism will be aligned with and find the political fulcrum points. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"By geographic distribution, this operative means that the renewed vitality on the left is most heavily concentrated in New York, Massachusetts and California, which are already Democratic. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Resilience in the face of setbacks will be a key test of the long-range viability of activist liberal organizations across the country. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"David Wasserman, an election specialist, describes the likelihood of Democratic frustration in 2018 in a detailed analysis published by FiveThirtyEight, “ "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-congressional-map-is-historically-biased-toward-the-gop/?utm_source=The+Point+with+Chris+Cillizza+Alerts&amp;utm_campaign=06f99649c5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_08_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_ada7c7ac0a-06f99649c5-83777321" target="_blank" title=""The Congressional Map Has A Record-Setting Bias Against Democrats.” As Wasserman writes, "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points — a pretty good midterm by historical standards — they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The combination of Republican gerrymandering and the clustering of Democratic voters in urban centers “has moved the median House seat well to the right of the nation,” Wasserman notes. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The result is what Wasserman calls a structural “partisan bias” favoring Republicans in Congressional elections: "css-1mqg2rq e2kc3sl0"Trump lost the national popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, but Republicans won the median House seat by 3.4 points and the median Senate seat by 3.6 points. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"Which is to say that Democrats will have an uphill struggle in 2018 to wrest control of either the House or Senate. Of the 25 Senate seats held by Democrats that are up for election next year,  "css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/politics/2018-midterms-trump/index.html" target="_blank" title=""10 are in states that Trump carried. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"In the past, Republican commitments to building strength at the local level have been sustained by trade associations and corporations with a financial stake in decisions made at the county and state level. There is every reason to believe these interests will continue to invest time and money to protect their profits. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"From 2010 to 2016, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was the single largest contributor to the Republican State Leadership Committee, steadily increasing its support over this period to a total of $14.9 million, according to the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.php?ein=050532524" target="_blank" title=""Center for Responsive Politics. Such companies as Walmart, Reynolds American, Eli Lilly and AT&amp;T are also substantial R.S.L.C. backers. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"The liberal donors and activists who have mobilized this year have a less materialistic stake in the outcome of local elections. If, as Wasserman’s data suggests, a major victory is beyond reach in November 2018, will these players regroup and fight on? Or will they retreat at the state and local level, as  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/opinion/campaign-stops/the-republican-partys-50-state-solution.html?_r=0" target="_blank" title=""they have in the past, leaving this refractory terrain to their highly motivated Republican adversaries?I invite you to follow me on  href="https://twitter.com/edsall"Twitter, @Edsall.emFollow The New York Times Opinion section on  href="https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion"Facebook and  href="http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion"Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the  href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/"Opinion Today newsletter. br//emAdvertisement "css-12lb1tb" "css-1ft1ynw" "css-whjxzo" "css-13sbuc"Collapse "css-hlo4bz"SEE MY OPTIONS
