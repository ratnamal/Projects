The government of China is subsidizing the growth of its electric car industry by providing very significant subsidies (about one-third of cost) to consumers.

It’s partly a sort of optical illusion. China dominates assembly of many goods thanks to a combination of still-low wages and an extensive industrial “ecology” of supporting firms. But much of the value of the good actually comes from elsewhere. For example, iPhones are “made” in China, but China  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/49894138.pdf" target="_blank" title=""only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"2. Not entirely — there’s some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules. But not too much. Consider Bangladesh: all it really has is a large labor force, with fairly low productivity. Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets. If we insist that they follow first-world rules, we’re basically telling them to go starve. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"3. It’s tricky. Subsidizing em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"consumers/em is O.K. under the rules, while subsidizing producers isn’t. If the U.S. offered tax breaks for electric cars, it would be perfectly legal under W.T.O. rules. The trouble is that given Chinese reality, you’re not going to see a lot of foreign electric cars sold there. But as these things go, it’s not a particularly egregious example. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"I remember in undergraduate school (1964) studying President Kennedy’s Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This was in a political economics class.

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"But the level of protectionism it would take to get those few percent back would have lots of ugly side consequences. If we want to help U.D. workers — and we do — there are better ways. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"You may remember Bernie Sanders using Denmark as an example. It’s a good one: much better wages, a much er social safety net, a mostly unionized work force. But Denmark is as open to world trade as we are. It’s domestic policies — from taxing and spending decisions to pro-labor policies in the service sector — that make the difference. Universal health care and the right to organize matter a lot more for workers than trade policy. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Why does the president of the United States have the authority to make decisions (such as imposing tariffs) that have significant impacts on the economy, trade, relationships with allies, etc. — with impunity, and with no input from Congress?

"css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"PK:/ Actually, Congress voluntarily limited its own role, to protect itself from special-interest politics: it votes big trade deals up or down on a single vote, then stays out of it. But given the realities of trade tensions, the system needs some “escape valves” — ways to provide temporary relief in hard cases. That’s why the president has certain ways he can impose tariffs: if there’s a finding that an industry has been injured by an import surge, if national security is at stake, if foreigners pursue unfair practices. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"However, these powers aren’t supposed to be used arbitrarily: there’s supposed to be an independent study of the issue, and the president acts on the basis of that study. What’s happening with Trump is an abuse of the process: the Commerce Department came up with an obviously bogus national security rationale for tariffs Trump wanted to impose for other reasons. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"So we have a process that gives presidents some discretion, for pretty good reasons — but one that assumes that said presidents will act honestly and responsibly. It falls apart when you’re dealing with someone like Trump. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Will we be able to undo this after this administration is voted out?

However, we might get into a full-scale trade war before that happens, and in any case the U.S. has already lost its reputation as a reliable negotiating partner. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"My question is: What role does free trade play in income inequality, and the concentration of wealth in a global economy? /em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"I have little/em em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"doubt that trade creates value. On average everyone ends up wealthier with free trade — better allocation of resources./em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Rarely do I see the unequal distribution of the value created by trade addressed. Sure, blue-collar workers all enjoy lower prices on apparel at Walmart with low-cost textiles from China, but some worker lost a $25/hour job in a U.S. textile mill, and the Walmart saving doesn’t offset the $15/hour job for that displaced worker. The downside of free trade is concentrated onto a relatively small group of people./em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"I also believe that financiers and the capital class keep a large part of the savings when U.S. jobs are sent offshore, and individual workers with limited geographical scope pay a price./em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"To me the question isn’t IF trade creates wealth, but for whom is the wealth created. — /em "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-trade-questions.html#permid=26254106" target="_blank" title=""em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Tom Stoltz/emem "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330", Detroit/em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"PK: /There’s been a lot of work on this question over the years.  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/growing-world-trade-causes-and-consequences/" target="_blank" title=""Back in 1995 I estimated that trade widened the gap between college and non-college workers by 3 percent, and that number has surely risen since, though maybe only a couple of points. By the way, the downside affects a lot of people, not just a small group. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"We also think that the  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121" target="_blank" title=""surge in imports between 2000 and 2007 displaced something like a million workers. Most of those workers eventually found other jobs, but many faced wage cuts and some communities got hurt badly. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"So this isn’t a subject economists have been ignoring. You just want to ask what’s the best way to help workers, and tariffs are rarely the answer. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Is a perennial (and rising) trade deficit desirable and even sustainable in the very long run? Much of our debt is now owned by other countries (see China and Japan for example). Are we not giving away ownership of our of national wealth to our trading partners? I am in favor of free trade but I was always puzzled by the decades-long rising trade deficit. Germany, for example, a Western democracy, manages to have a trade surplus (with the help of the euro of course, but they still make goods people want even outside the eurozone). I have read explanations that the privilege of having a reserve currency has a price, which is maintaining trade surpluses, and this in turn allows for lower interest rates and higher growth. Sounds interesting but still can we make the case that the rising debt is sustainable for the long run?

And as a result, the U.S., which was a creditor country before we began running persistent deficits since 1980, is now a net debtor. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"But you want to keep some perspective. Our “net international investment position” — overseas assets less liabilities — is about -45 percent of G.D.P., which isn’t that big a number, all things considered. For example, it’s less than 10 percent of our national wealth. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And the idea that this gives foreigners a lot of power over America has it backward. On the contrary, in a way it makes them our hostages: China has a lot of money tied up in America.

Did the Great Depression unfairly give tariffs a bad name or did the field of economics just advance beyond tariffs as part of the economic policy tool kit? — /em "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-trade-questions.html#permid=26255279" target="_blank" title=""em "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330"Jason Williams/emem "css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330" Washington, D.C./em "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0" "css-8qgvsz euv7paa0"PK: /Actually, economists were  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/this-day-in-politics-herbert-hoover-smoot-hawley-act-107908" target="_blank" title=""overwhelmingly against Smoot-Hawley. There has always been a minority view supporting tariffs under certain circumstances — usually for economic development. But the failure of import-substituting industrialization in Latin America and India largely discredited that view.

McCarthy’s whole article is premised on the notion that protectionism can bring back a manufacturing-centered economy. I couldn’t find any facts at all about trade in his article, certainly no numbers. "css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"And if you actually do look at the numbers, you immediately realize that his whole premise is wrong: we could shut down trade completely and manufacturing would still employ  "css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/972886746903011329" target="_blank" title=""less than 10 percent of the work force.
